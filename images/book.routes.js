    { title:'Infinite Jest',
    author:'David Foster Wallace',
    genre:'Humour, Satire, Science Fiction, Tragicomedy, Postmodern literature, Hysterical realism',
    desc:"Infinite Jest is unique; it was bred in the optimism and new frontiersmanship of the dot-com 1990s but was simultaneously an early omen of where we are today. It looks into our present beyond what were only horizons when it was written: the tensions of a global economy, the opiate of on-demand entertainment, the near-impossible pursuit of greatness in a winner-take-all society.",
